# Design Ideation and Final Design Selection


After we completed our user needs, we brainstormed any ideas we coudl think of that complies with our necessary measures. This landed us with three results. The first idea was a home automation system that will open and close blinds depending on the temperature and brightness in a room. The Second was a temperature and light controlled fan, which would turn on when it's too hot or lights turn on. The third result we thought of was an automated door opener that senses when someone is near and will open the door.  After much consideration, the Home Room Weather Control System made the most sense to us; We felt that this idea would be best since it needed the exact amount of components and sensors to make it work for the requirements of this project, unlike the other ideas. 
  
The way this project would operate is by reading the internal conditions of a room to control the blinds. If it's too bright, the light sensor will close the blinds through the use of a motor controlled by the system. If it's too hot inside, it will close as well and if the room is cold then the blinds will open. In summary, it is designed to control blinds intuitively.

  This chosen project allowed us to satisfy the project requirements. Next, it was a case of desiging our subsystems and figuring out what parts we would use. This entailed creating a block diagram of how our subsystems would interact with eachother, and what components we would be needing to choose.
