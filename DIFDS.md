# Design Ideation and Final Design Selection


  After we completed our user needs, we brainstormed any ideas we coudl think of that complies with our necessary measures. This landed us with three results. The third result we thought about was an automated door opener. Second was a temperature and ligth controlled fan, which would turn on when it's too hot or lights turn on. Our final design, which is what we chose, is a Home Room Weather Control System. This chosen design would operate window blinds based on external and internal conditions. If it's raining, the humidity sensor will close the blinds through the use of a motor controlled by the system. If it's too hot inside, it will close as well. If the room is cold, then the blinds will be opened, if external conditions meet specified criteria. A full copy of our design ideation can be found in [Appendix C](/03-design-ideation.pdf)
