title: Component and Microcontroller Selection
-----------------------------------------------
 
# Beginning Approach
We read the project requirements very closely to ensure that we were picking components that are allowed to use for our design. While doing research on components, we focused on parts that incorporated detailed datasheets as well as immediate accessibility. With past experience of struggling to obtain certain parts, we wanted to be certain that we had immediate access to start testing and debugging our current concept selection.

We began our search with components that we have worked with in class since we are familiar with them. We first listed out the pros and cons of the parts we used in previous assignments then we would look for similar components that would offer solutions to the cons we had listed. For subsystems that required a part not used in a previous assignment we would choose a few components that each had different strengths and weaknesses.

Once our possible choices were listed out we then chose the best option prioritizing ease of use, such as a package size manageable enough to hand solder as well as accesibility to external recources.

# Temperature Sensor
The TC74 temperature sensor is a serial sensor manufactured by Microchip. It can measure temperatures between -40C to 125C and outputs Data using I2C. The voltage supply range for this sensor is a minimum of 2.7V to 5.5V. We were given this sensor in class and there was information on it provided which made the selection of this component an easy decision. This sensor is also a very manageable size which is important since it will be surface mounted onto the PCB.
