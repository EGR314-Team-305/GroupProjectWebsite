# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements  
  When deciding upon which ideals are most important to the customer, we utilized a process similar to reverse engineering. We first collected multiple items similar to our desired project idea, and researched information on them. This allowed us to discover many uailities about the products, such as price, vendor, and many positive and negative reviews about each one. This allowed us to move to our next process: Jamboards.
  
  A Jamboard is a sheet of notes with every idea, note, ideals, specifications, etc., about a given topic. It is similar to a whiteboard with dozens of post-it notes all across it. Digitally, we wrote down as many notes we could think of or find in the user reviews of similar products. This created a mess for us to sort through. We then organized them by what category they fit into. Project requirements, user wants, user needs, marketing, etc. After this, we rated each note based on how important it is to us as well as the customer, thus producing our main user needs.
