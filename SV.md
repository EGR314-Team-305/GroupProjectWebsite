# System Verification

One of the last steps for our project is to make sure that each subsystem we created individually can be connected together. This ensures that everyone's project works, and that we worked cohesively as a team. This process involved wiring every system together and rigorously testing every aspect.

For our first attempt, we were able to get it powered up with base subsystems working. This included our voltage regulator and our microcontroller.

Although not much, it was a start, and after some further debugging we were able to get the microcontroller to program successfully, as well as verify that voltage was indeed reaching other sybsystems.

After several hours of further debugging, we were able to establish that the wireless communication and temperature sensors were working.

Next, we were able to utilize the same technique developed to correct the temperature sensor on the light sensor. This allowe us to test our motor, since it was dependant on the other sensors.

With everything working correctly, we shot a short video documenting the final verification. This was so that we have proof that it worked in case something happened to the main system before we could finally present. Showing that everything worked correctly, here is our final verification.
