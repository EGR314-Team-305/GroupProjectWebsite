# Team Organization

  Entering another project based class, our team needs to be a well functioning machine where every aspect works. Resulting in the team Charter, we developed a page of expectations for us to follow. This includes but is not limited to teamwork, communication, quality of work, and much more. 

  Our mission statement is that we want to learn about the detailed creation of subsystems and circuit boards. Through the process of creating a home automation system focusing on simplicity and reliability, we can create a system of multiple functioning pieces. Although sometimes complicated, creating this system of subsystems will allow us to learn and demonstrate growth in the field of engineering
  
  Ensuring that all members of our group complete their share of work to a standard sufficient with our level and expectations, all members of our team have agreed to and will follow the examples mentioned in the original document, [found here](/01-team-organization.pdf) or on our main page in [Appendix A.](https://egr314-team-305.github.io/Team305.github.io/#appendix) 

  With finding the members of our team, we initially went for friends first. Although this is usually against what we are supposed to do, each of us brought something uniquely strong to the group. Jack brought a heafty amount of experience in coding, resulting in him being named Head Coder. Uriah has made circuit boards in the past, leading to his role as our PCB (Personal Circuit Board) Designer. Diego has in depth knowledge of the 3D modeling program Fusion 360. This allowed him to easily take the role of our Head Designer. Nicholas, as well as most of the others, was found to have knowledge of all these main tasks, but not enough experience to outclass anyone. Thus, with his knowledge of the inner working of websites, he was named Website Designer.
