# Block Diagram

  With figuring out what project we were going to work on came the process of brainstorming the workflow of the circuit we are creating. Figuring out what we would be using and listing how it would connect with eachother was the primary focus of this portion of the project, as well as determining who would be responsible for each subsystem. Aiming to create a full block diagram would allow us to visually represent the circuit board in a clear and easy to understand form.

  In this process we saw that course requirements determined that we would be using a Microcontroller to ESP32 communication to transmit data through bluetooth. With this part selected by default, we decided to put Nicholas on that subsystem, as he has had experience with the component in the past. 

  Other components listed down to our base requirements: 2 sensors and a motor controller. The motor controller, like it's name implies, controls a motor through external data given through the main system of the group. Given to Uriah, this subsystem is reliant on data fed to the system from the other two subsystem sensors.

  For our remaining two components, Diego and Jack were able to select their own sensors at will, with approval from the professor. Selecting a temperature sensor, Diego utilized a component we were familiar with to optimize time on the project. Focusing on our last sensor, Jack chose to challenge himself with a light sensor. This component was challenging to auire and implement, thus leading to a very unique version of the project.

  In the above block diagram we listed every part of our project, retroactively labeling each block with port information, part numbers, communication types and additional information necessary for us to understand each segment. We also added greater detail about subjects like power, voltage regulation and control buttons. This allows us to visualize the porject from a base view that most people could read and understand. Consolidating our unique subsystem information like this also allows us to view eachothers subsystems and get knowledge of them without doing the research each member had to do initially.
