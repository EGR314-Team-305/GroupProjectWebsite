## Introduction: Team 204 Semester Project   
  With entering another project based class comes a semester project. For this project, we need to create a custom weather based system that includes multiple sensors and electronical communication. For communication aspects, we intend to use ESP32 two way bluetooth communication that we will be taught in class. This will allow the user to view variable data produced by the final product we intend to create. Additional sensors for this project include motion, light, humidity, air pressure, temperature, and many more. We decided to go with light and humidity, as it fits with the project idea that will be stated below. Finally, we will need a motor and motor controller, functioning based on data given by the rest of the system.
  
  Conisidering the part requirements listed above, we decided to make a Home Room Weather Control System. This device will open and close window blinds depending on external factors, such as humidity, light and temperature. The motor will control the blinds, and at what speed they move.
  
## Team Organization
  Entering another project based class, our team needs to be a well functioning machine where every aspect works. Resulting in the team Charter, we developed a page of expectations for us to follow. This includes but is not limited to teamwork, communication, quality of work, and much more. Ensuring that all members of our group complete their share of workto a standard sufficient with our level and expectations, all members of our team have agreed to and will follow the examples mentioned in the original document, found below in [Appendix A.](https://egr314-team-305.github.io/Team305.github.io/#appendix) 

  Our mission statement is that we want to learn about the detailed creation of subsystems and circuit boards. Through the process of creating a home automation system focusing on simplicity and reliability, we can create a system of multiple functioning pieces. Although sometimes complicated, creating this system of subsystems will allow us to learn and demonstrate growth in the field of engineering

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements  
  When deciding upon which ideals are most important to the customer, we utilized a process similar to reverse engineering. We first collected multiple items similar to our desired project idea, and researched information on them. This allowed us to discover many uailities about the products, such as price, vendor, and many positive and negative reviews about each one. This allowed us to move to our next process: Jamboards.
  
  A Jamboard is a sheet of notes with every idea, note, ideals, specifications, etc., about a given topic. It is similar to a whiteboard with dozens of post-it notes all across it. Digitally, we wrote down as many notes we could think of or find in the user reviews of similar products. This created a mess for us to sort through. We then organized them by what category they fit into. Project requirements, user wants, user needs, marketing, etc. After this, we rated each note based on how important it is to us as well as the customer, thus producing our main user needs. A full copy of our user needs can be found in [Appendix B](/02-user-needs-and-requirements.pdf)
